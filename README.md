# ALX---Data-Analysis-Nanodegree-Program
This repository contains the entirety of projects carried out during the course of the ALX Data Analysis program with Udacity.
### Project 1
In this project, the dataset analyzed was the kaggle's noshowappointment dataset(<a href>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments</a>) and I had to determine what factors were important for us to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment.
### Project 2
In this project, the dataset wrangled and analyzed is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs(<a href>https://twitter.com/dog_rates</a>). I was expected to scrape data from the account on Twitter using a developer API, and then analyse the data extracted to determine what factors influenced the ratings for different dog pictures.
### Project 3 (Capstone Project)
This project was more on visualizations. In this final project, I analyzed the <a href> San Fransisco Ford GoBike dataset</a> dataset, the dataset which includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in order to determine what features influenced the duration of trips made.
